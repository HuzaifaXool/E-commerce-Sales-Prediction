# Machine Learning Project for E-commerce Sales Prediction

This is a machine learning project designed to predict e-commerce sales using historical data. The goal is to develop a model that accurately forecasts future sales based on various factors such as price, units sold, and date.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HuzaifaXool/Ecommerce-Prediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd Ecommerce-Prediction
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    conda create --name venv 
    ```

4. Activate the environment(as i have developed this whole project using linux):
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

    - On Windows :
      ```bash
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

5. Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    python3 setup.py install
    ```



## Daily Updates
